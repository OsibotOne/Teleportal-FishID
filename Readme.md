# Teleportal - FishID: AI Fish Species Detection System

## **Project Overview**
The Teleportal - FishID project focuses on developing an AI system to identify fish species from 720p resolution underwater videos captured on the Great Barrier Reef. The AI will detect and identify the top 10 most common fish species, integrate seamlessly with the Teleportal website, and deliver results to users via email after reviewing their dive footage.

---

## **Key Features**
### **1. AI Fish Species Detection**
- **Training Data**: Uses 720p resolution underwater videos for model training.
- **Target Species**: Focuses on the top 10 fish species found on the Great Barrier Reef.
- **Accuracy Goals**: Optimised for high precision in species identification, even in diverse and dynamic underwater environments.

---

### **2. User Experience**
- **Video Review**: Users automatically upload their dive footage to YouTube via the Teleportal platform.
- **Automated Analysis**: AI processes the footage to identify fish species.
- **Email Reporting**:
  - Users receive a detailed email report listing all identified species.
  - Includes timestamps and insights to enhance their dive experience.

---

### **3. Integration with Teleportal Website**
- **Seamless Workflow**: 
  - Process videos via the existing Teleportal interface.
  - Display analysis status and results through the user dashboard.
- **Backend API**: Facilitates smooth communication between the AI system and the Teleportal platform.

## **Expected Deliverables**
1. **AI Model**:
   - Fully trained and tested on 720p resolution underwater videos.
   - Capable of accurately identifying the top 10 Great Barrier Reef fish species.
2. **Integration**:
   - AI integrated into the Teleportal website for video uploads and analysis.
   - Backend system to manage video processing and user data.
3. **Email Notification System**:
   - Automated system to send detailed reports of identified species.
4. **Documentation**:
   - User guide for uploading and reviewing results.
   - Technical documentation for AI training, deployment, and integration processes.
